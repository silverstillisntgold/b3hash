THIS IS VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS AND SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR
ANYTHING SERIOUS.

Currently, using this as a command line program means manually
commenting out what you don't want to do and recompiling each time.
After the library itself is more-or-less finalized I'll work on
using the Clap library to make command line usage viable.

When this is reasonably stable (soon^(tm)) it'll get a 0.1.0 cargo release.
